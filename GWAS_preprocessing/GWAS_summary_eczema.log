2025/10/22 08:42:48 AM Interpreting column names as follows:
2025/10/22 08:42:48 AM MarkerName:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
EAF:	Allele frequency
A1:	a1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
Pval:	p-Value
Beta:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
A2:	a2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SE:	Standard errors of BETA coefficients

2025/10/22 08:42:48 AM Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /home/jupyter/shared_resources_307/GWAS_summary1/w_hm3.snplist
