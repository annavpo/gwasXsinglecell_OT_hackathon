2025/10/22 10:39:50 AM Interpreting column names as follows:
2025/10/22 10:39:50 AM MarkerName:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
EAF:	Allele frequency
A1:	a1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
Pval:	p-Value
Beta:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
A2:	a2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SE:	Standard errors of BETA coefficients

2025/10/22 10:39:50 AM Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /home/jupyter/shared_resources_307/GWAS_summary1/w_hm3.snplist
2025/10/22 10:39:51 AM Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
2025/10/22 10:39:54 AM Reading sumstats from /home/jupyter/shared_resources_307/GWAS_summary_psoriasis/summary_stats_GCST90558096_hg38.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
2025/10/22 10:40:03 AM Read 1556405 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 1554511 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with SE <0 or NaN values.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1894 SNPs remain.
2025/10/22 10:40:03 AM Adding uniform sample size 444887 to summary statistics.
2025/10/22 10:40:03 AM Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1894 SNPs remain).
2025/10/22 10:40:03 AM Removed 0 SNPs with N < 296591.333333 (1894 SNPs remain).
2025/10/22 10:40:03 AM Median value of Beta was 0.001711935, which seems sensible.
2025/10/22 10:40:04 AM Removed 85 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1809 SNPs remain).
2025/10/22 10:40:04 AM Writing summary statistics for 1809 SNPs (1809 with nonmissing N) to /home/jupyter/shared_resources_307/GWAS_summary_psoriasis.sumstats.gz.
