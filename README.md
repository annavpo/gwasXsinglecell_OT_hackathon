**Integrating GWAS with single-cell data to identify pathogenic cell types and prioritise targets in inflammatory skin diseases**

> üß† *Part of the [Open Targets Hackathon]([https://www.opentargets.org/](https://github.com/opentargets/hackathon-tasks)) *

## Overview  
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic loci associated with **inflammatory skin diseases** such as **psoriasis** and **atopic dermatitis**, but the **pathogenic cell types** underlying these signals remain largely unknown.

This project is meant to bridge this gap by integrating **GWAS summary statistics** with **single-cell RNA-seq** data from healthy and diseased skin to:
- Identify **cell types** enriched for genetic risk.
- Compute **gene-level cell-type specificity scores**.
- Prioritise **therapeutic targets** in their **cellular context**.

## üéØ Objectives  

| Goal | Description |
|------|--------------|
| üß© **Integrate GWAS + scRNA-seq** | Combine genetic association data with cell-type resolved transcriptomics. |
| üî¨ **Identify pathogenic cell types** | Determine which cell populations drive disease risk in psoriasis and eczema. |
| üß¨ **Prioritise target genes** | Compute gene-level cell-type specificity scores to rank causal/effector genes. |
| üí° **Contribute to Open Targets Platform** | Prototype a new ‚Äúcell-type specificity‚Äù evidence layer. |

## Approach  

### 1Ô∏è) Data Collection  
- Retrieve GWAS summary statistics for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis from the **[GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/)**.
- Obtain **credible sets** from the **[Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/)**.  
- Gather **public scRNA-seq** datasets from healthy and diseased skin.  

### 2Ô∏è) Integration & Analysis  
- Calculate Beta values using *mtag_munge.py* in *CELLECT-LDSC*. For ease, have an input file that looks like **[GWAS input](https://github.com/annavpo/gwasXsinglecell_OT_hackathon/blob/main/GWAS_sumstats_preprocessing)** 
- Estimate cell-type expression specificity score using **CELLEX**.  
- Perform genetic prioritisation using **CELLECT-MAGMA** or **CELLECT-LDSC**.


### 3Ô∏è) Output  
- List **disease-relevant/etiologic cell types** per condition.
- Cell-type specificity scores for prioritised targets
- Visualisation and summary reports
